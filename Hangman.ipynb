    "# Hangman Game in Python  \n",
    "*(Last Updated: 14 Aug, 2024)*  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎮 **Game Overview**  \n",
    "- **Objective**: Guess a hidden word letter-by-letter before running out of chances.  \n",
    "- **Origins**: Victorian-era game, also known as \"Gallows\" or \"Hanger.\"  \n",
    "- **Rules**:  \n",
    "  - A random word (e.g., a fruit) is selected.  \n",
    "  - Player guesses one letter at a time.  \n",
    "  - Correct guesses reveal the letter(s) in the word.  \n",
    "  - Incorrect guesses reduce remaining chances.  \n",
    "  - Chances = `word length + 2` (e.g., \"mango\" → 7 chances).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 💻 **Implementation**  \n",
    "1. **Setup**:  \n",
    "   - Use Python’s `random` module to pick a word from a predefined list (e.g., fruits).  \n",
    "   - Initialize hidden word display (e.g., `_ _ _ _ _` for \"apple\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gameplay**:  \n",
    "   - Prompt player for a letter guess.  \n",
    "   - Validate input (single alphabetic character, case-insensitive).  \n",
    "   - Update displayed word if correct, decrement chances if wrong.  \n",
    "   - Track guessed letters to avoid repeats.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **End Conditions**:  \n",
    "   - **Win**: All letters guessed (`a p p l e`).  \n",
    "   - **Lose**: Chances exhausted (reveal word, e.g., \"The word was 'pomegranate'\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🍎 **Example Word List**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"mango\", ...]  # 30+ options"
